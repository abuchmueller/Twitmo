The goal of `Twitmo` is to facilitate topic modeling in R with Twitter data. `Twitmo` provides a broad range of methods to sample, pre-process and visualize Tweets to make modeling the public discourse easy and accessible. This `README` covers the most important features. For more details use `vignette("Twitmo")`.

## Installation

You can install `Twitmo` from CRAN with:

```{r cran-installation, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("Twitmo")
```

You can install `Twitmo` from github with:

Before you install from Github make sure you have Rtools for [Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/ "Rtools for Windows (CRAN)") or [macOS](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/cpp/r-compiler-tools-for-rcpp-on-macos/ "Rtools for macOS") already installed.

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
## install remotes package if it's not already
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}

# YOU CAN CREATE YOUR GITHUB ACCESS TOKEN HERE
# https://github.com/settings/tokens
# PASTE THE STRING INTO THE AUTH_TOKEN ARGUMENT 

## install dev version of Twitmo from github
remotes::install_github("abuchmueller/Twitmo",
                        auth_token = "YOUR_TOKEN HERE")
```

## Example: Collect your tweets

Make sure you have a regular Twitter Account before start to sample your Tweets. For more sophisticated sampling you'll need a developer account. Use `vignette("sampling", package = "Twitmo")` to learn more about Twitter's endpoints.

### Work in Progress: Use included examples for now as `get_tweets()` is not well documented.

```{r}
# get_tweets()
```

## Parse your tweets

```{r}
dat <- load_tweets("inst/extdata/tweets_20191027-141233.json")
```

## Pool tweets into document pools

```{r}
pool <- pool_tweets(dat)
pool.corpus <- pool$corpus
```

```{r}
pool.dfm <- pool$document_term_matrix
```

## Find optimal number of topics

```{r ldatuner}
find_lda(pool.dfm)
```

## Fit LDA model

```{r}
model <- fit_lda(pool.dfm, n_topics = 3)
```

## View most relevant terms for each topic

```{r}
lda_terms(model)
```

or which hashtags are heavily associated with each topic

```{r}
lda_hashtags(model)
```

## LDA Distribution

Check the distribution of your LDA Model with

```{r}
lda_distribution(model)
```

## Visualize with `LDAvis`

Hint: Make sure you have `servr` package installed.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
to_ldavis(model, pool.corpus, pool.dfm)
```
